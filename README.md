# Project2:
UWA students huangzhuang and yuqianghu worked together on Project.Python/Flask + html/css/js to implement a simple sudoku server and web side.
The project consists of the following main modules.
base.html (main)
Login.html
Logout.html
Register.html
Admin.html
play.html
Relu.html
Rank.html (Ranking of all users)
User.html(personal display)
and back-end database data storage

First we created the login page and the registration screen. After that we added a game screen to entertain the users and a rules screen to allow the users to understand the rules. In order to attract users for the long term, we added a user display and a ranking screen.
During testing we populated all the grids in simple mode to test and verify that the data could be sent from the front end to the routes and the routes saved to the database. It can be extracted from the database to the rank page and the admin page. Of course admin requires permissions.
