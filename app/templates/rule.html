<p>The rules of Sudoku are simple, as the name suggests -- each number can only appear once. Sudoku is a nine - house, and each house is divided into nine small cells. Use logic and reasoning to fill in the remaining blanks with numbers from 1 to 9. Make each number 1-9 appear only once in each row, column, and house. The numbers in each line are 1-9 and are not repeated. Note: Every eligible sudoku puzzle has one and only one answer, and the reasoning method is based on this. Any problem with no or multiple solutions is not eligible</p>
